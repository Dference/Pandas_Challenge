# Pandas Challenge
## School Rules
The challenge begins with building a data set that paints a picture using: Total number of schools, Total students, Total budget, Average math score as well as the percentage of students who passed math,
Average reading score as well as the percentage of students who passed reading, and the overall percentage of students who passed.
## Under the microscope
Using the data gathered, we then begin to delve deeper into the data to break down what factors shifted results for the students, showing corralation between variables that led to success or struggles. These data factors were the same as listed above, but broken down to the per school subset, we are able to better see direct results between factors like school size, budget allocation, and whether schools were charter or district schools.
